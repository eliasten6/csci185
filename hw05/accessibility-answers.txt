1. What corrections did you have to make?

I had to add names with aria and set a language for my website.

1. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?


Yes. You can tab to certain pages and they all have names.


1. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

Yep!


Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!
